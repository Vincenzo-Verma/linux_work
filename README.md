## Getting Started with Linux kernel development learning
 - Start by making sure all the requirements are met by installing the dependencies
    ``` sudo apt install build-essential vim git cscope libncurses-dev libssl-dev bison flex ```
- and setup git-email
    git it by ` sudo apt-get install git-email `
